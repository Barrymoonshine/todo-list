## Summary

This To Do List application is a personal tasks manager that allows users to add new tasks to a default or custom project.

Users can organise their tasks by date or priority using the sidebar navigation, and individual tasks can be edited or expanded to show their full details using their own navigation bar.

Tasks and projects are stored locally using the Web Storage API so a user can access previously added tasks even when refreshing their browser window.

This project was made as part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) full stack javascript curriculum.

## Key learning points

- Organising module javascript files following the object role stereotypes approach for consistent responsibilities
- Using the Dates-FNS external library to do the heavy lifting when manipulating dates with javascript
- Web Storage API to locally save data
- Designing a user interface with two forms and multiple navigation points
- Adding a favicon to the browser tab for an additional touch of style!

## Later improvements (To do's!?)

- Make the site mobile responsive
- Provide an option to sort by completed tasks
- Add an option to delete projects
